## Skins
Thanks to all the artists who created original My Little Pony skins for Minecraft. It was your work that inspired me to make this mod, and I borrowed a lot of ideas (and quite a few pixels) from your original skins. I hope you forgive me. Twilight Sparkle, Rarity and Applejack (as well as many other ponies) was based on skins by **k9saurus**. Celestia and Luna were based on a skin by **peaceiscloser**. Fluttershy was based on a skin by **paladinwat** (which itself was based on skins by **kirapt0r**, **netbelleanie**/**rawriza**, and **kjhf**...). I sadly cannot remember where I got the skin on which I based the new Rainbow Dash, if it was you then thanks. The other skins were based at least in part on the work of these artists

I messed around with some of their skins a bit before I added them to the mod in some cases, so if you don't like something about any of the skins then that's probably my fault rather than any of these people who are all amazing

The skins for the mobs were made by me, inspired by the default Minecraft mobs. The zombies use some elements from the mob skins in the [Love&nbsp;and&nbsp;Tolerance](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture_pack/love-and-tolerance-texture-pack/){target="_blank"} texture pack. The skeletons were made by **dann494**
