> All files above are required except HD Skins mod. This mod lets you upload skins to our own skin server via in-game interface which also supports HD skins.

## Installing LiteLoader
Once you've downloaded all the files you need to install LiteLoader. Open your downloaded installer file (e.g.&nbsp;`liteloader-installer-1.12.2-00-SNAPSHOT.jar`) and follow instructions on the screen.

## Installing the mod
After installing LiteLoader, you need to add your mod to the game. Place downloaded `.jar` files into `mods` folder in your Minecraft directory:

- `%APPDATA%\.minecraft` on Windows
- `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft` on macOS
- `~/.minecraft` in Linux

## Play your game!
If everything was done correctly, a new Minecraft profile called something like `fabric-loader-1.15.2  ` should appear. Choose it and launch the game. Now you should turn into pony!
