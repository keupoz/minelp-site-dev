- [Fabric API mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api){target="_blank"}
- [HD Skins mod (optional)](https://github.com/MineLittlePony/HDSkins/releases){target="_blank"}
- [Mine Little Pony mod](https://github.com/MineLittlePony/MineLittlePony/releases){target="_blank"}

> All files above are required except HD Skins mod. This mod lets you upload skins to our own skin server via in-game interface which also supports HD skins.

## Installing Fabric
Once you've downloaded all the files you need to install Fabric. Open your downloaded installer file (e.g.&nbsp;`fabric-installer-0.5.2.39.jar`) and follow instructions on the screen.

## Installing the mod
After installing Fabric, you need to add your mods to the game. Place downloaded `.jar` files into `mods` folder in your Minecraft directory:

- `%APPDATA%\.minecraft` on Windows
- `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft` on macOS
- `~/.minecraft` in Linux

## Play your game!
If everything was done correctly, a new Minecraft profile called something like `fabric-loader-1.15.2  ` should appear. Choose it and launch the game. Now you should turn into pony!
